        <p>To my Cookies that aren’t familiar with Cajun cuisine, allow me to introduce you to a delicacy here in Louisiana. The Crawfish. Nothing gathers people together more than a good ole Crawfish Boil down here! Listen, this little red suckers bring a different kind of joy to our hearts! I can’t even explain the taste. But, let me try…It’s kind of like a mini lobster with 100x more flavor! Of course, everyone here has their own way of boiling. You already know I had to come up with the easiest method that also has the most flavor! Here’s how I prepare my Crawfish Boil and bless my folks!</p>

            <li>Place water hose into cooler and run water into the cooler with the drainage hole opened.</li>
            <li>Remove any dead crawfish (if the tails are straight, they’re gone!)</li>

            <li>Cover the pot with the lid to encourage the boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add on the potatoes.</li>

            <li>Cover and allow the crawfish to soak for at least 30 minutes; or until the corn and sausage is done, and the majority of the crawfish has sunk to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Remove the steamer insert and allow it to drain.</li>
